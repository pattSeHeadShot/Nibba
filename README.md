<h1 align="center">Whack - A - Mole üî®</h1>

**Whack-a-Mole** is an exciting, interactive web-based game where the player‚Äôs goal is to quickly "whack" moles that randomly pop up from a grid of holes.
The game is built using `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`, providing a simple yet enjoyable challenge for players. Every successful click on a mole earns points, testing both the player‚Äôs speed and accuracy.

HTML is used to structure the game‚Äôs interface, CSS adds styling and animations for dynamic mole appearances, while JavaScript drives the game logic, such as random mole pop-ups, the scoring system.. This fun project is a great way to practice front-end web development skills while creating an engaging user experience! üéÆüéØ
